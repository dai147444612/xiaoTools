# Hexadecimal Tools - HexUtil

## Introduction

> Hexadecimal (abbreviated as hex or subscript 16) in mathematics is a carry system that enters every hexadecimal number. It is generally represented by numbers 0 to 9 and letters A to F (where: A~~F is 10~~ 15). For example, the decimal number 57 is 111001 in binary and 39 in hexadecimal.
>
> In order to distinguish between hexadecimal and decimal values, languages like java and c will add 0x in front of the hexadecimal number. For example, 0x20 is the decimal 32 instead of the decimal 20. `HexUtil` is a tool class that converts a string or byte array to a hexadecimal representation.

```java
String str = "I am a string";
String hexStr = HexUtil.encodeHexStr(str);
//e68891e698afe4b880e4b8aae5ad97e7aca6e4b8b2
System.out.println(hexStr);
//I am a string
System.out.println(HexUtil.decodeHexStr(hexStr));
```
