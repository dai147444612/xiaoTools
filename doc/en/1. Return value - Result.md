# Return value - Result

## Description

> The Result return value is a headache for everyone when interacting with the front end, because if it is not very standardized, it is troublesome to use, but if you use the Result in `xiaoTools`, it will become standardized and simple.

## API introduction

##### type of status code indicates that the action was successfully received, understood and accepted

```markdown
- `result200(Object message, String path);` ===> The request is successfully completed and the requested resource is sent to the client.
- `result201(Object message, String path);` ===> Prompt to know the URL of the new file.
- `result202(Object message, String path);` ===> Accepted and processed, but the processing is not completed.
- `result203(Object message, String path);` ===> The returned information is uncertain or incomplete.
- `result204(Object message, String path);` ===> The request was received, but the returned information was empty.
- `result205(Object message, String path);` ===> The server has completed the request, and the user must reset the currently viewed file.
- `result206(Object message, String path);` ===> The server has completed some user GET requests.
```

##### type of status code indicates that further processing must be accepted in order to complete the specified action.

```markdown
- `result300(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested resource is available in multiple places.
- `result301(Object message, String path);` ===> This page was permanently transferred to another URL.
- `result302(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested page is redirected to the new address.
- `result303(Object message, String path);` ===> It is recommended that users visit other URLs or access methods.
- `result304(Object message, String path);` ===> Since the last request, the requested page has not been modified.
- `result305(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested resource must be obtained from the address specified by the server.
- `result306(Object message, String path);` ===> Declare that the requested resource is temporarily deleted.
```

##### type of status code indicates that the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be executed correctly.

```markdown
- `result400(Object message, String path);` ===> The client request has a syntax error.
- `result401(Object message, String path);` ===> The request is unauthorized.
- `result402(Object message, String path);` ===> Keep a valid ChargeTo header response.
- `result403(Object message, String path);` ===> Access is forbidden, the server receives the request, but refuses to provide the service.
- `result404(Object message, String path);` ===> The server can be connected, but the server cannot obtain the requested webpage, and the requested resource does not exist.
- `result405(Object message, String path);` ===> The method defined by the user in the Request-Line field is not allowed.
- `result406(Object message, String path);` ===> According to the Accept sent by the user, the requested resource is not accessible.
- `result407(Object message, String path);` ===> The user must first obtain authorization on the proxy server.
- `result408(Object message, String path);` ===> The client did not complete the request within the time specified by the user.
- `result409(Object message, String path);` ===> The request cannot be completed for the current resource state.
- `result410(Object message, String path);` ===> This resource no longer exists on the server.
- `result411(Object message, String path);` ===> The server rejects the user-defined Content-Length attribute request.
- `result412(Object message, String path);` ===> One or more request header fields are wrong in the current request.
- `result413(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested resource is larger than the size allowed by the server.
- `result414(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested resource URL is longer than the length allowed by the server.
- `result415(Object message, String path);` ===> The requested resource does not support the requested item format.
- `result416(Object message, String path);` ===> The request contains the Range request header field, and there is no range indication value in the current request resource range.
- `result417(Object message, String path);` ===> The server does not meet the expectations specified in the Expect header field of the request.
```

##### This type of status code indicates a server or gateway error.

```markdown
- `result500(Object message, String path);` ===> Server Error.
- `result501(Object message, String path);` ===> The server does not support the requested function.

- `result503(Object message, String path);` ===> Unable to obtain service.
- `result504(Object message, String path);` ===> The gateway timed out.
- `result505(Object message, String path);` ===> Unsupported http version.
```

## how to use

> There is only one test template here. You only need to change the number to directly use other required APIs.

```java
/**
 * Result Examples of class
 * @author HCY
 * @since 2021/4/29 8:34 上午
*/
public class ResultExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Result result = result200();
    }

    /**
     * Others are similar
     * Just modified part of the quotation marks in Result().result`200`()
     * @author HCY
     * @since 2021/4/29 8:42 上午
     * @return com.hcy.code.result.Result
    */
    private static Result result200() {
        return new Result().result200("[返回的具体信息](可以是万物)","[调用Controller的路径](API路径)");
    }
}
```
